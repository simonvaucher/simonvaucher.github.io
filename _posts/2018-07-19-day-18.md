Fall in Ontario. Yes, it's real.

I suddenly felt like recovering in the middle of the day. That was a nice feeling of a sudden focus in thoughts, that helped me in a particular annoying debug chase at work. That sensation followed into the evening/night - I managed to transplant a pot, clear weeds, keep the kitchen intact and even wash the car (?!?). Classic convalescence stage, I guess, some over-reaction of the body.

Eating behaviour is well controlled lately - same 200-calories cap after 18:00. Hunger is almost non-existant, the body is indeed adapting (and probably compensating for that in another time frame during the day).

I have some crazy unfinished story with some Amazon order that got stuck due to an over-zealous international shipping company: A receiver from Amazon.de that requires a permit from the ministry of telecommunication... Long story short, I should prepare a bunch of papers and somehow email those to some obscure address, or basically do UPS's job. Fun fact: the ministry's offices are located within walking distance from my workplace, but there is only a single day in the week that could match and I think I should rather go through the standard procedures. Tempting, though.
