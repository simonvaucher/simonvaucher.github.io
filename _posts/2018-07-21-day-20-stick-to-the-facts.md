This is something I absolutely fail to understand - why people all around the world keep talking about diets and meal compositions in general terms, while COMPLETELY overlooking the facts. Just plain, simple, observed facts.

It all started with a missing feeling of hunger in the evening, which was an unexpected surprise. Since it's the weekend, I must break the 200-calories rule, right? Not because I'm hungry, just because I ought to. Yeah, it's quite stupid. Anyway, that led to a simple, really dead-simple weighting of the ingredients composing a standard bowl of cereals - an exact copy of my typical breakfast. Just facts, kapish? Bring it on:

---

| Granola | Cornflakes | Oatmeal |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 450-580 | 370 | 370 |

Shocking, isn't it? Again, simple methodology: 200ml of 3% milk (constant across cereal types) = 120 calories. Weight of ingredients vary between the light Cornflakes that easily fill up the bowl and the heavier Granola / Oatmeal. Just to compare, a plain simple 500ml beer (the reference), which by all means quiet down even the worst of hungers, is worth 210 calories. What about swallowing 1500ml of beer in one gulp?!

Among other things, this plain-dead-simple check is yet anothera affirmation that the term "beer belly" is utterly false. One can drink beer all day long without gaining weight, the (quite severe and unnecessary) intoxication will get him first.

Well, for me a simple stride down the memory lane reveals countless evenings in which I gulped easily 2000 calories as some late night treats. Just like that. I should probably re-consider my breakfasts - the quantities I measured are not exagerated, and if I fill only half of the bowl (actually, a third instead of two-thirds) the portion would be a bit ridiculous.

I bet that a piece of bread smeared with a heavy layer of butter or jam is much more diet-friendly. Another measuring session should follow, I guess. I already confirmed that switching to yoghurt (or some kind of buttermilk, to be exact) along with a tablespoon of jam is also worth about 200 calories (a 500ml beer in the morning? I don't think so...). Fascinating stuff.
