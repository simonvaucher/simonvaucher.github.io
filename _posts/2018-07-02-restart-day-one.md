Well, here's the point of reference / starting status:
- Weight: 83 kg
- BMI: ~27.5

It's hard to find a subject that causes more concern than weight gain. There are good reasons for that, it's not only a matter of external appearance or health, basically it drills down to control, and this ominous feeling of losing control, even before your body stops responding to your will.

Funny things is that the hidden/unspoken truth about weight loss is that in the end it boils down to a simple equation of calories in vs calories out. The answer is: "eat less", yet, for some reasons I just cannot understand, that's one of the hardest thing in the world to do. There is something in that feeling of hunger that somehow makes us go nuts.

OK, going nuts. Eating less. Let's see if we can manage to make any change before the end of the year.
