> Back to the old days, when the camera of the Samsung Note MK I wasn't scratched (it lasted like that about a year). I eventually resorted to the front-facing camera at some point in time. Poor design flaw of a rather nice phone.

Well, I should probably call this "diet update" but it may be better to describe it as "habit forming update" instead. Diet is usually percieved as some goal-reaching process with an end, but I am trying, like many good folks out there, to make a change that is intended to last.

Keeping the calories count has been quite successful. I get the occasional growling noises of an empty stomach in the evening, but it is more funny than annoying. Hey, I am also saving money because of this, no kidding! It is unbelievable, the amount of resources that can go just like that, evaporate in the thin air.

Speaking of money, I am still suffering from that shopping spree which I have yet to put under control. This is probably connected to the sleeping habits which are still not formed. For example, yesterday I actually completed the tasks I've set for the day (quite a feat!), and all the remaining tasks were marked as either "nice to have" or "too complex to start". I should have gone to bed but wasted valuable time instead in endless surfing. Better change that.
