### Health / habits updates
- General: feeling exhausted
- Weight: back to 80.0+ kg, I should probably ignore ANY change in the 2 kg range due to... fluids management issues? :)
- Exercise: muscles still sore, 5 days (!) after a single exercise session (!!) that lasted 8 minutes (!!! WTH). Flexibility is decent, though, but I am not happy with this condition overall.
