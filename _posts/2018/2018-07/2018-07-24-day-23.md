It's a good example where the tool dictates your way of processing thoughts. When writing down thoughts, or architecture, or whatever, the writing has to follow some rules or basic classification. These rules are not that much applicable for blog posts, but for documenting stuff they are invaluable. OK, let's try to use some of that wonderful markdown stuff in the next section.
