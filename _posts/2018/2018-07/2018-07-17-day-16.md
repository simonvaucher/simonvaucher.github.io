> Can't get cheaper than that: Cheap ring lighting (quite visible in the dropplets reflection) paired with flimsy plastic extension tubes. The inherent sharpness of the 35mm helps to save this photo from total disaster, but the one thing I am perfectly proud of is the pitch-black background (plain simple black cloth).

I finally got my act together and completed arranging the seeds in proper containers. It appears that I have enough good-quality lettuce seeds for an entire state, that particular vegetable sprouts easily. Also got some celery seeds - those sprout all year long but suffer from a short growth period (like almost anything else) during the summer. Looking forward for autumn.

Will be probably back on my feet and at my desk tomorrow. Not really looking forward to that, but gotta bring some bread to the table. I've just completed a rather disastreous shopping spree while being ill, so better end it right now by simply having something else on my mind!
