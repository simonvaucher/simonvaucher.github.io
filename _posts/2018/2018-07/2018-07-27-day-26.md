> Not much today, but at least I tried - a heavy crop of the full moon eclipse using the 35mm lens on the Sony - which was much sharper than the kit lens on the 55mm side.


#### Health / habits updates
- Weight: 79.0kg, sometimes less. Encouraging!
- Exercise: still getting sore muscles for DAYS, even after 8 minutes of excercise. I am either in a REALLY sore shape or the exercises are just brillianttly focused. Anyway, happingly keeping the focus on the big core hip/glutes muscles.
