This blog is already being written at a two-days delay. I've wondered before if it's ok to write ahead some posts, just in case (Jekyll won't show those to the end-user before the set date in the settings). Oh well. ðŸ˜®

That lag is, as expected, in all fronts with the zillions of tasks I've been given/taken, but due to the constant writing down of almost any possible idea/task/to-do/whatever, usually on some "notes" app, I am able to keep track somehow. I am actually not bad at prioritization, especially for the immediate / short term tasks, it's the long term goals that I'm struggling with. No wonder I am not a CEO of anything. ðŸ˜œ

Speaking of goals, the 200-calories limit after 18:00 is celebrating two weeks, with about 2 lapses in the meantime, not bad at all, and certainly a better start than anticipated. Weight hasn't changed but that's not something I should even bother checking before two months have elapsed.
