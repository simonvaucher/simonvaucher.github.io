I had the privilege of attending one of Paul Sellers' workshops (was that two years ago? already?!) and while listening I also scrutinized every tiny movement he made with his hands and upper body - that was fascinating to watch, to say the least. Seemingly effortless, that was the first impression, but that's only one part of the picture.

I am not too fond of Paul's writing sometimes, they are bafflingly not as articulate as his real-life presence or as his instructional videos. Nevertheless, this blog post struck right in: [In the beginning exercise restraints](https://paulsellers.com/2018/07/in-the-beginning-exercise-restraints).

This subject connects very well with the issues I've described here in some posts - the need to re-learn how to move. I am getting better at that, but I still have much to learn, e.g. in garden chores. Digging in hard loamy soil is a nice workout but it could be a much more efficient workout if I had ever cared to sharpen my shovel and practice systematic digging movements.
