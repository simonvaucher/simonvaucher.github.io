There are dozens of videos out there explaining more or less the same things - basically, learn how to rotate your hips "inwards" to prevent stress on the back.

I've discovered about a year ago I need to re-learn how to stand and move. Just "keeping your back straight" is not enough, unless one has extraordinary good reflexes and a natural posture, these things needs to be learned, like holding your fork.
