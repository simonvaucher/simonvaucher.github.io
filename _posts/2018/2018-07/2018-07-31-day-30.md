> No wonder setting up web pages has become so complex - here's a perfect example.

When changing the index template of the site to present whole blog posts instead of excerpts, I added a "go to top" link at the bottom right side of each blog post. Nice idea at first, also nice-looking placement, but when using an actual hand-held device an interesting problem surfaced up immediatly - when scrolling down with your thumb, sometimes the thumb accidentaly tap the "go to top" link and... well, losing your scroll position is not much fun, right?

Anyway, moving the link to the center. Perfect example of an aesthetic choice that collides with usage (or yet another difference in css between mobile and desktop).
