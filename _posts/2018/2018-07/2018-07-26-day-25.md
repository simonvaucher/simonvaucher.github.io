Done in a single day, two 40-min sections, phone and headphones only.

There's no way I will ever match the "one blog post a day" pace in the music department, but even putting down a single musical idea during a random daily commotion is satisfactory. I wonder if I can do that weekly.

This theme / idea desperately asks for a "B" section and complementary vocals, but interestingly enough, it has already the rhythm section "baked inside". It is not just a chord progression, the heavy 90s'-ambient-inspired drums are inseparable from the rest.

That Caustic app is impressive, I've bought it ages ago and it matured well - unlike the majority of music softwares out there, it is intuitive and doesn't get in your way. I especially liked the ability to modify the volume of individual percussion instruments inside each pattern - it immediatly softens the mechanical repetition and gives a "breathing" natural quality.
