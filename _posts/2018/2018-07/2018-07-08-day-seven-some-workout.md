Finally got some workout yesterday. Collapsed after 15 minutes but at least got some nice stretches. It still amazes me how easily I get sore muscles from core workout - is my core THAT weak (yup, probably it is).

Diet-wise the weekend has been a predictable disaster, as are all weekends, but I was quite prepared for that. Back on track, continue with that balance. Sleeping time is not stable yet either, it looks like I need to restrict even more the number of tasks I allow myself to complete each day.
