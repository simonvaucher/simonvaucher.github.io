> phone picture, but a good one.

Feeling quite bad in the last couple of days, sore throat etc. Actually, I don't recall feeling REALLY good & vibrant in the last years, since the first child was born. Funny thing is, during the only two occasions I could really relax in a kid-free environment thanks to some ultra-expensive pampering vacation organized by a wealthy workplace, I was terribly sick.

Not aging well, I should say. This is not really frightening because there's nothing to be afraid of in the not-so-distant future, but it's an uneasy feeling. Could I ever feel vibrant in this earthly body again? Or was it just a tainted, nostalgic memory?

Sidenote: Getting appropriate titles is proving, as expected, to be an arduous task. Reminds me of the Pet Shop Boys album names - those are always, without expection, a single word which has never appeared in the lyrics.
