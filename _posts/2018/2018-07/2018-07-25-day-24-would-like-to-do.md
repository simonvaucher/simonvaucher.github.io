Actually, some of the things in the following list have been done, but it would be nice to re-do a second, improved run.

- [ ] Soap making: second batch with tougher bars
- [ ] Cheese: maybe use rennet? with current cheese prices that's actually stupid
- [ ] Extract rosemary essence / oil
- [ ] Iceland! I would also settle with a greek island, though
- [ ] Trestle oak table for the kitchen: I have all the material
- [ ] Complete SYP bookshelves project
- [ ] [Fun woodcarving](https://youtu.be/AlIr95-ZlCc)
- [ ] Less relapses
- [ ] Convert grandma's recording and upload for everyone to enjoy
- [ ] Refinish mom's coffee table with proper Danish soap (original finish)
- [ ] Music: Got material, no inspiration

Actually, that music topic is interesting. I could compose in the past electronic music without any vocal, but that has switched - I just cannot for the life of me think of some music that just stands alone, per se, it has to have some extra-musical meaning. 

That leads to other strange problems - first, the language (composing in English seems silly since it's not my native tongue or my THOUGTS tongue). Secondly, the lyrics. Oh boy, the lyrics. Finding lyrics that I can relate to and that were not used at least 784 times already in innumerable songs is nearly impossible. I did some preliminary experiments in writing lyrics and those were quite awful, as expected. Maybe that blog thing, where I force myself to write everyday OUTSIDE of the internet forum realms will help release this "writer's block", LOL. Writer. Come on...

Another very old problem - vocals. Like many musicians, I dislike my voice and although it got much better lately, it has still that nasal tone combined with some weird accent that is simply not what I would like to hear. My wife's voice also doesn't quite fit the idea I have in mind. There are wonderful professional vocalists out there that I can connect to, but getting in contact without having material first is silly.

Lyrics. First the lyrics. I would be very happy to use a modern reflection / adaptation of the Bible's psalms, especially because the original meter used ~4000 years ago cannot fit ANY current beat. It is the most crazy unregular meter you could think of. Yup, big challenge.
