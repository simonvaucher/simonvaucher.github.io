> Back to the old days, when the Samsung Note MK I's camera wasn't scratched. I eventually resorted to the front-facing camera at some point in time. Poor design flaw of a rather nice phone.

Having all posts inside the same `_posts` folder was getting cumbersome, so I moved everything inside subfolders. It werks!! I guess that's mentioned somewhere in the Jekyll documentation. I really like this tool, it is flexible enough exactly where it *should* be.

Also replaced the site's description with the Public Domain Mark. I had tough time finding an svg which not... errrrr... wait for it... drumrolls please... UNDER COPYRIGHT (?!) - are you kidding me? Anyway, eventually found what I needed in Wikipedia.
