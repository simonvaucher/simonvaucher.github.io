Some old recurring hobby: quasi-cheese making. Why quasi? Because I've never gone beyond the step of heated milk and vinegar / citric acid. Basically, all I've ever made was heavily-pressed milk Ricotta. No rennet, no cultures, no dedicated cellars with controlled humidity etc.

The recipe is simple: 2-3 liters of milk, 200ml of yoghurt (for flavor), ~50ml of white vinegar (acetic, 5%, synthetic). Heat milk & yoghurt to ~88c / ~185f, remove from heat, pour vinegar, and from then on slowly filter/remove whey (not really whey technically, but never mind). When the curds are dry enough, combine with salt and put in a makeshift press overnight.

The result is not great, yet not bad - it tends to become a very dry and crumbly cheese with a faint yoghurt flavor. Putting more salt or covering in brine results in some fetta-like cheese, where the dominant flavor is, well, salty-acidic (yawn). I had a cheese once that got a bit rancid, like white mold, and it was actually great (I would be probably put to jail in the European Union for that). I also wrapped once a cheese with a mix of candle wax and beeswax and from some reason the taste of the waxes seeped inside (that one was terrible).

As a first step, it may be wise to find the limits of this method, e.g. for how long can the cheese be aged in **room temperature**, like anyone else did **barely 100 years ago**. The internet is full of how-tos and opinions but it seems that no one dared to cross the boundaries, out of curiosity. Why not? This is an inexpensive hobby.

- [ ] Omit yoghourt
- [ ] Infect with blue/white mold
- [ ] Wash regularly with brine etc.
- [ ] Oil wash
- [ ] Wine wash
- [ ] Incorporate herbs (sage/thyme)
- [ ] Give up and buy rennet / calcium chloride / mesophylic culture / a goat
