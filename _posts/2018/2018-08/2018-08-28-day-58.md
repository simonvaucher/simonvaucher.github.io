We had an unusual temperate summer around here. Higher humidity but almost record-low maximum temperature. Very beneficial for the garden, which reacts badly to dry weather.

Most peppers have emerged but only a few have matured, in my experience it takes a lot of time, especially in a shady garden. Nevertheless, that particular speciment which was picked from a surprisingly small brush matured early, to perfection 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️.
