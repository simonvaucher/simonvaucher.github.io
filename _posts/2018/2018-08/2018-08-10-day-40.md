## What I would like to add
###  Categories for future search
- I didn't exactly get what is going on here with `Jekyll`, some strange static file generation. Actually, you could keep all keywords necessary for search in the single index page, the total number of strings is still laughabable when comparing to any client-side javascript framework...

### Refine styling
- Not 100% happy with the serif font. There's gotta be a serif font which fits the bill, not giving up. Yet. :)

### Refine embedding
- YouTube is using iFrames, I don't know where I can ease/speed things up here. I am sure more can be done. Same with Flickr images, I am still not sure wether should I keep the surrounding container which include some javascript code, or switch to pure images only.
