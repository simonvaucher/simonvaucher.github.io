## [soap calculator link](http://soapcalc.net/calc/SoapCalcWP.asp)
Nothing beats HTML v1.0 sites with square forms and tables. This is about the only soap/lye calculator in the net, since it is SO better than anything else out there. They didn't miss even a single vegetable oil, and the "soap qualities" chart is very useful (i.e. bubbly vs creamy vs bar hardness etc). Highly recommended.

I have two personal favorites:
1. Pure coconut oil soap, hard, durable, shiny and bubbly
2. Random mix of about 6-7 oil types, including the base oils which are found about everywhere: Palm, coconut and olive (unrefined). Other soaps which included a higher ratio softer oils like avocado / almonds turned out either too soft or rancid.

I also encountered a big difference in terms of hardness and durability between cold process and hot process - the latter being very stable for years - but it may be unrelated and due to other factors.
