> "6 bass trombones, 6 tenor trombones, 4 tubas in the middle and 6 french horns above..." - Hans Zimmer, 2011

Will this cure my obsessive attraction to Zimmer's music?!

It is unreasonable to expect outputing a truely original one-minute musical sketch each week. All the greatest composers learned by copying previous masters, and way back in the past I liked very much "cloning" other composers in the study of orchestration - especially Beethoven. Ludwig's method of spreading chords in the orchestra is still unique in my opinion.

I am quite surprised by how well it sounds, even though this version is heavily auto-clipped (great feature of Caustic). I couldn't find any machine that was remotely close to that brass sound, but nevertheless, one particular machine inside gave the proper "fat" sound, some kind of string/lead mixture.

Funny, though; We may have used every possible combination of diatonic/harmonic/melodic progression ever, yet it feels that in terms of sound we are still exploring, thanks to the endless variations and combinations of live, physical instruments and electronic instruments.

Done in 40 minutes on phone, while commuting, plus another 40 minutes or so of struggle with iMovie and YouTube...
