That was long overdue: recycling some old soap (too soft / stale / crumbly) using hot process and a large amount of oils that contribute to a harder bar - coconut oil and palm oil.
In my very limited experience in soap making, I've discovered that hot process soap yields a better-behaved soap comparing to cold process, although that might have been purely accidental. Nevertheless, since this batch consist of at least 50% old soap, it will mix much better using the hot process anyway, so that's a no-brainer.
Using every last available round whisky container available... :-)

Side note I: An important discovery I've made since starting with soap making, about two years ago: Aim for the thickest possible soap bar. Both adults and kids handle those better than tiny/flimsy ones.

Side note II: The soap ended up looking so bad, that I've added the last few bits of dried-out titanium oxide I had at hand (at least 20 years old), which only made things worst. Too funny. :)
