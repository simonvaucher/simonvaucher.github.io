Although that seized back has crippled me quite badly, I nevertheless accomplished a few tasks:
- [x] Move all rosemary cuttings to pots
- [x] Get all lavender cuttings and some rosemary cuttings to shoot properly
- [x] Get decent coffee roasts from Columbia variety only (a mix of dark and light roasts)
- [x] Clean the workshop (except the workbench, but from now on it'll be easy)
- [x] Maintain house in good order. It is actually tidier than ever.
- [x] Long-overdue soap making (hot process)
