Well, that was quite stupid - it hasn't occured on my mind that kites were more-or-less invented in China, and that they are to this day a very, ahem, Chinese thing. Those two came from some kite capital in China, and unlike other marketing mambo-jumbo, I totally believe that. There are only tiny flaws in the construction, and the purple kite is flying very well, as expected from a proper delta-type kite.
