> An invisible finish?

This is a finish what was once common in Scandinavia, and mentioned by Chris Schwartz in ["The Anarchist's Design Book"](https://lostartpress.com/collections/books/products/the-anarchists-design-book) (nothing anarchistic about this book, the logic behind the title can be found on the net).

The recipe is simple: take pure soap flakes, dissolve in water, spread like wax, sand or polish, repeat if necessary. I use homemade soap, made from NaOH and Coconut oil - this is the hardest type of soap (palm oil is a close second), with a brilliant white hue which doesn't spoil like vegetable-oil-based soaps.

The resulting finish looks like a low-luster wax finish, which looks especially good on lighter woods, the complete opposite of the common yellowing oil/varnish finishes. Like wax, the protection offered is miminal, but unlike any other finish, the re-application is extremly easy - no need to sand or strip anything, just grab a towel, fill with watery soap and rub in.

Actually, it's the only finish I could think of that is self-cleaning. Worth a try.
