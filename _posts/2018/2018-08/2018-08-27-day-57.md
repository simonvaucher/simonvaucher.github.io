Lower back is slowly recovering, today was significantly better. Still taking deep breath whenever moving between postures, just to get the spine moving to a comfortable position before applying the necessary pressure when rising up. Do I feel like an invalid? Yes, a bit :/

### Health / habits updates
- Weight: stable, 79.5 kg
- Exercise: quite active physically, no proper HIIT exercises yet due to stiff back.
- Calories intake: Regained control, back to feeling hunger.
- Sleeping habits: More sleep than ever, but badly divided into random naps / exhaustion collapses.
