Very firm, crumbly cheese with a distinct yoghurt taste, keeps over a month. When heated, it browns instead of melting, creating a funny squeeky sound when munched. First experiment with lots of unfounded/unconfirmed steps, so take everything written here with a grain of salt.

## Yield
- ~360 gr

## Ingredients
- 3 l milk (3%)
- 200 ml yoghurt
- 50 gr citric acid (diluted in water)
- 1 tbsp salt

## How To
- Warm milk and yoghurt to 46&deg;C, cover and let ripen for an hour (this may be totally wrong since both the milk and the yoghurt were from the commercial pasteurized variety).
- Heat to 88&deg;C while swirling continuously to avoid scorching.
- Remove from heat, create a fast swirl and pour diluted citric acid inside.
- Let curdle form for the next 5-10 minutes.
- Add more citric acid, or white vinegar if the "whey" is still too bright (should be yellowish & almost clear).
- Gather curds carefuly inside a cheese cloth, drain, add salt & mix
- Press for 12 hours.
- Air-dry for about 12 hours.
- Salt if necessary, turn a few times in-between saltings.

## Notes
- The yoghurt step was meant to mimic some termophilic culture, but it actually only affects the taste. We shouldn't expect any microbial activity after heating to 88&deg;C. Yes, it can be omitted.
- Could use more salt, more like 15-20 gr.
