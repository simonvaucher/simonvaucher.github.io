> That's how ~7 days of air-drying looks like

Well, the photo speaks for itself. Nice range of molds, at least three different kinds. Behind the beautiful yet deadly rind hides a sharp cheese, very close to a blue cheese. Nice random success.

I won't have much time in the near future to deal with cheese, but I am quite satisfied with this proof-of-concept. Note for future reference: Cheese needs A LOT MORE attention than it seems, even when just air-drying. Daily inspections, flips and salt rubs are an absolute must.
