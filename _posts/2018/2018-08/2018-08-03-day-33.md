### Health / habits updates
- Weight: stable, 79.0-80.0 kg
- Exercise: about nothing last week, but muscles are not sore anymore, it looks like the body recovered at last (took more than a week).
- Calories intake: OK except weekend which was wilder than usual ;-)
- Sleeping habits: that has to be fixed, not getting enough sleep
