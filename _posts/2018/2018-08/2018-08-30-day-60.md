### Health / habits updates
- Weight is surprisingly stable, considering the fact that I haven't did a single exercise for the last ~3 weeks. After about a week of losing control on the calories intake, things got back to normal, and it's a simple calculation that you just cannot ignore.

### Highly hypothetical calculation just to make a point
- Assuming the average calories intake before introducing the regime was 800 per evening (not far fetched), it's about 500 less calories per day, multiplied by 60 => whopping 30,000 calories. Even when considering the body's re-adjustments, this is an extraordinary figure.
