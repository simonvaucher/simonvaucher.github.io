> To do: add matching picture(s) to the posts from the last few days. I actually have pictures matching the subjects!

Got a terrific photoshoot of the family thanks to my talented sisters. The kids responded extremly well to the direction and some pictures are just a joy to look at. Now, how do I add a matching yet secure picture to prove this? Grumbl grumbl.
