> Common green mold. Does not contribute to the taste, unfortunatley. It is the same mold infecting stale bread. Apparently, and contrary to the popular belief, it is 100% edible (people with wierd alergies aside) - just not palatable.

This is how [cheese no. #2]({% post_url 2018/2018-08/2018-08-13-day-43-cheese-2 %}) looked after a few days in the bottom part of the fridge, unturned. According to the condensation inside the plastic container, the humidity was 100%. That's quite a tough problem - the fridge is usually too dry for anything, but most attempts to rectify the humidity results in hairy results, like above. In this case, I discared/scraped the mold, cleaned the container add poured a significant amount of salt over.

That cheese was "infected" with 20 gr only of _Danablu_ cheese, and it started as some strange flavored ricotta. Much to my surprise, a week later the taste got a bit sharper / stronger - did the infection succeed? I cannot see any streaks of blue _Penicillium roqueforti_ though, so maybe there's another change or fungii strain involved here. All in all, it actually WORKS: take a cheap, bland cheese, mix it with a strong blue cheese, wait a bit, and voil√†.
