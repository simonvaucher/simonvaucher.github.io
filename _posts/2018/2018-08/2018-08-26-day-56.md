> Fall is near.

One has just falled, the other one started to burst while still on the tree. The taste is quite bland, I never managed to get a decent fruit from this somewhat neglected tree. Should probably invest more time & money in proper composting and soil aeration - this tree is at the edge of the garden and doesn't get much attention (full sun, though).
