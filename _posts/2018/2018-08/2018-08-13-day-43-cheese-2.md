Well, it is actually a batch of pressed ricotta that was mixed with a strong Danish _Danablu_ cheese. Whether or not is this an actuall infection which promots _Penicillium roqueforti_ growth or just a stupid mix (that _Danablu_ is very strong...) - only time will tell. In this particular experiment I had a problem with the pressing, so it was not nearly as firm as [cheese no. #1]({% post_url 2018/2018-08/2018-08-12-day-42-cheese-1 %}).

## Yield
- ~330 gr

## Ingredients
- 3 l milk (3%)
- 90 ml acetic acid (5%)
- 25 gr salt (that's a bit too much, actully)
- 20 gr _Danablu_ (store-bought commercial variety)

## How To
- Heat milk to 88&deg;C while swirling continuously to avoid scorching.
- Remove from heat, create a fast swirl and pour acetic acid.
- Let curds rest for a few minutes, drain, salt, combine with the _Danablu_.
- Press for 12 hours.
- Remove from press and poke a few holes from top to bottom with a clean skewer.
- Air-dry for 2 days, flipping cheese every now and then.

## Notes
- I haven't had the guts yet to leave a cheese completly untouched until it REALLY begins to grow mold, any kind of mold.
- As stated earlier, this is actually a flavored ricotta, it doesn't seem the cheese was actually infected.
