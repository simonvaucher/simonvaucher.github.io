This is an experiment in progress - trying to press as best as I can some salty Ricotta, and letting it air-dry in room temperature until it is bone-dry, without any refrigeration. We'll see about that.

The makeshift press I've made a few years ago is giving me all sorts of problems, I should probably give up and get a proper plain and simple cheese basket, and rebuild a much simpler wooden press without concrete craziness. Ha! When I think about it, I could go full retard and even discard the metal parts - just tap and thread a real wooden screw. Another sad example of a tool that was bought ~2 years ago and never used :(

## Yield
- ~460 gr after initial press. Quite high! I expect it to reduce significantly after drying.

## Ingredients
- 3 l milk (3%)
- 90 ml acetic acid (5%)
- 20 gr salt

## How to:
- See [cheese no. #2]({% post_url 2018/2018-08/2018-08-13-day-43-cheese-2 %}) - same procedure except nothing was added to the curds here.
- The goal is to let it air-dry completly, covering with salt accordingly when needed. Maybe a brine wash?
