Tough weekend, blog-wise. Added "go to index" to the single blog post template. I could've used some `location.goBackInHistorySomething()` via javascript but I found out more than once it is nice to have a complete, exact history, even when it includes getting back several times to the same index.

Also made another one of those endless font size & styling modifications. Serif fonts are tricky to set up right, even in modern laptops/phones screens with crazy PPI.
