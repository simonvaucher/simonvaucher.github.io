I was surprised to discover that this summer hasn't been a financial disaster. As always, I am the biggest spender, with this totally unecessary audio/video upgrade... oh well. It appears that little kids don't need ANYTHING except spending quality time, alternating between indoor and outdoor activities.

Somehow I managed to resist buying some tools, although I could crack anytime. The "woodshop" is clean but the workbench still needs much TLC. Getting there.
