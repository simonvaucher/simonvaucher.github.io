> To complete: picture of the mentioned Japanese toolbox

Completed in a hurry (well, a relative hurry, about two days) a simple Japanese toolbox to hold the kids' bicycle apparel. I like it very much, the lid trick works well even with an old piece of recycled 3-ply plywood, and the toolbox itself is surprisingly sturdy - you can insane weight on top of it, due to the peculiar construction which has zero stress points in the vertical level.

Definitly not the last box I'll make in this fashion. I should probably make a bit of effort in the looks department, though, this is barely acceptable.
