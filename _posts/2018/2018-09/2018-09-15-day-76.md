I've run a fun experiment with the kids: watching together a funny yet full-length movie in English (a language they do not understand) while serving as a mediator to both the script and the too-strong emotions that are triggered by frightening scenes and evil characters. Kids differ greatly in their capability to handle frightening scenes, and the role we can play as parents could be crucial for the more sensitive ones.

I wonder how would that whole situation would look like if I had used their native tongue's soundtrack (which is some lame stereo, difficulties of a snob dad). We'll never know...
