Following the re-collapse into Netflix's binge watching, all kinds of positive behavior have suffered a great deal - especially the sleeping habits, which I failed to appreciate correctly thus far. Eating frenzies haven't triggered yet a weight gain, but as we already know, delayed consequences are the real problem here - I could potentially gain weight two months from now whithout understanding the cause.

Why I am doing this to myself? What is triggering us to intentionally lose control? Why is the mind/will so weak?

### Health / habits updates
- Weight: 78.5-79.5 kg.
- Exercise: Started walking from work to bus station, about 40min, 2 times a week. Not bad.
- Calories intake: Quite bad lately, when I am overstepping it, it is always a ~1000 calories penalty.
- Sleeping habits: Probably linked to the calories intake, worse than ever.
