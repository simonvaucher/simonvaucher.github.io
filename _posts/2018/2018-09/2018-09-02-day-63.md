Guess what? The automated "magic view" of your camera roll only process the last ~1000 images or so. You'll search in vain for your former cat, it will never appear. I haven't had high expectations to begin with, but still... there is not a single photo storage / backup / business / whatever that can REALLY help you find older pictures, forget about organizing them. I'll continue relying on the combination of my failing memory and random searches. Sheesh.
