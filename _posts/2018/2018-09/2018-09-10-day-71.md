> Nice glimpse of autumn. Already washed away by a heat wave, unfortunately. The bright thin line in the horizon is actually the sea, a rare sight.

I actually managed to involve the children in a coffee roasting session, which is by definition a boring task. Usually, I overcome the boredome by watching my subscribed channels in YouTube, it works like a charm. Good kids, always full of enthusiam. And I bet these are the only kids in a significant radius that could describe to their baffled teachers the roasting process in an elaborate fashion, down to color, smoke and popping stages...
