September was a very bad month for business (unending series of holidays), so I could not really put to the test my, ahem, food system, but nevertheless it is going well. Just bring proteins to work in a form of (usually) roasted beef, add some freshly picked lettuce and spices, and complete the carbs with some bread provided by the workplace.

I should probably start to bring my own bread, though. It is so much better...
