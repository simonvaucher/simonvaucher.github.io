> To add: hot peppers shoot

Oh, one thing I forgot to mention in the previous post: The hot peppers are doing great! The Jalapenios have absolutly no taste for some reason (they are not even spicy) but on the other hand, the Habaneros are TERRIFIC - hot as hell and tasty.

I am especially happy to see the chocolate Habanero, these are the tastiest of the bunch. Not shown in the picture - the pale greenish/yellowish variety which is the slowest to mature. That has also happened to me last year, so it's probably a trait of that particular type. On the up side (well, depends how you look on it) those pale looking Habaneros are the DEADLIEST of the bunch.
