This is a thing I've been doing for a long time, but I am still only beginning to get better at it: When the handplane's blade feels dull (not nicked, only dull), just remove the blade, clean everything, and hone the blade quickly with a 6000 grit diamond stone (the one that seems to do absolutely nothing).

Oh, wait, I've skipped the most important part of the process: break the invisible wire edge by stropping the blade on your BARE SKIN (inner palm, outer, does not matter). It will suddenly feel very sharp, and you'll gain a whole full session of, errr... sharpness (?). This process takes about two minutes, really.
