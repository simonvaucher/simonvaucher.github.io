> My appologies for the lousy shot. Yes, it is that big. That's how those are build nowadays (?).

After a funny/sad episode with some bureaucratic elements, I've decided to return the order from Amazon that never got to me. What ALWAYS happens in these cases, is the inevitable "upgrade" in both prices and features. When I think of it, EVERYTHING started with the cancellation of Netflix. Yikes, scary.

Anyhow, I got this nice receiver now, which is capable of handling everything you throw at him. You can search the web for its back side, it is hillarious, an infinite array of audio connections from any possible kind, even an AM antenna (why???).

Only now, after switching from random 2.0 downmixes, I can really appreciate the sound quality of blu-ray discs. It is jaw-dropping, really. Only now I fully understand how DVDs sound bad. I should be very careful with my choice of prints and re-issues though, the situation is as bad as ever, you can to this day get SD material with unsynched sound, exactly like the old CD re-issues. Classic corporate stuff.

Recommendation? The same movie I've been watching for the 7th time, approximatly: _Inception_. The subwoofer channel is quite active in this movie, and with this proper setup you can fully appreciate how the music acts as the binder/vehicule for the whole plot. Inspiring. Deeply moving. Really, honest.
