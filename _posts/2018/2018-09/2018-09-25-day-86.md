Taking another break from Netflix, after checking one of the latest super-hero movies and breaking down in the first third. The exact name of the movie doesn't matter, you can put in multiple names. Man, what is this junk?!

Yes, I know I sound like an old fart, but this super-hero stuff is getting on my nerves, never again. Unless Nolan decides to attack the subject, of course, but he probably knows better, judging by the decision to take Batman.
