Interstingly enough, the first week of combined return-to-school and return-to-work forced a change in the sleeping habits, since the waking hour switched at once to a strict one, usually 06:30am. The holidays will test this change, as always, but that is temporary. One of the side effects is, unsurprisingly, a collapse from exhaustion earlier in the evening, but that also may come from the sudden usage of the brain at work. Really, it's like I haven't been properly exploiting the full capacity of my brain during the end of the summer.
