> The kind of craft you do "for the kids". Too tedious for most ages, yet impressive - the flowers unfold in a very gracious manner.

I was asked (again) this strange question the other day - if you would suddendly receive a nice inheritance that would take care of your financial stress, let's say 20 million quids, what would you do?

I stopped a long time ago to bother myself with pointless "what if" questions, the honest answer is: "I haven't got a clue". Living in regret is a common subject of great conflict in various dramatic genres, but in the real world it is a sad condition. People that just accept the reality while having a balanced attitude towards wishes and yearnings are happier and more positive. Argh, that poor word, "positive", it has suffered so much abuse, you can't use it anymore.

Another plausible answer, which is even more honest: "I would probably make some very bad decisions that will cause me much trouble". In short, this falls under a favorite category of mine: "wrong question". There are good questions, bad questions, and wrong (usually unfair, sometimes loaded) questions.
