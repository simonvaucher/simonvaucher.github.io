Inexhaustible? Timeless How would you call this Danish marvel? Fun fact: the actuall "secret" to Lego's success (besides very clever choices of the themes) is not the visible part of "the system", but actually the underside, the extruded rods that hold unto the underlying building block. Lego experimented with several types of bottom extrusion. The one they came up with is pure genius. How could they get plastic mold SO accurate in the 1960's, way before computerized CNC? Hats off.
