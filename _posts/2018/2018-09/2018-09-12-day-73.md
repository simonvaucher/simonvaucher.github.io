First post after 3-week hiatus. As it is customary to blame someone/something else instead of admitting to your shortcomings, I accuse Netflix.

The "official" trigger to re-apply to the service was the much needed (ahem) check of their surround capabilities, especially via the 1st generation of the chromecase device (which holds up surprisingly well for a 1st generation device of any kind). As expected, the comparision to some of the lossless DTS-HD-something blu-rays I have is unfair, but nevertheless the Dolby Plus sounds perfectly fine, a very noticeable improvement over the poor old Dolby / Surround (which is, quite frankly, terrible).
