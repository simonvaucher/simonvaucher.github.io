> This is not a workbench.

It took about two hours to complete something I've been delaying for almost six months - cleaning the workbench in the workshop. I immediatly proceed to make some shavings, sure enough.

You cannot really separate the action from the mind, I guess. I could not really clean the workbench before because the mind was simply not cooperating. The timing is not accidental - that was the first occurence of that rare moment in the week when the kids are at their place, and I am home-alone, but not because I was forced to (sickness etc.). The sane side of the routine.
