Good news - weight has been steady for the whole last week on the 78.7 kg mark. Still far from that nice 70.0kg round figure, but comparing to the 82~ I've been carying around for the last few years, it is definitly an improvement. When looking at my non-existent exercise schedule, it's easy to affirme the cause of the change - a single, simple decision: limit calories intake to ~200 after 18:00.

Once could also argue that I've stopped to stuff myself like a pig during lunch, and that's not entirely untrue, but I don't consider this as an important factor.

Conclusion: I've been experiencing this two-month delay between change and result over and over. This is quite baffeling, honestly. Two months? two months to assimilate a change in the body? One possible guess: maybe, before the deep change kicks in, the body is resisting the change by triggering other "survival" mechanisms? I've read some theories along this line.
