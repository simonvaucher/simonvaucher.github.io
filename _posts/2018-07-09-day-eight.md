Nice tip from an osteopath (bones wiggler?) - when breating, try to breath deep until your tailbone moves. Opera singers will know immediatly what I am talking about - lay a support for the breathing control. This is a simple way to force your muscles/bones to move, especially for seaters. Shallow breathing will barely move the abdomen.

Back to usual 200-calories restriction after 18:00 & tight sleeping schedule. I feel tired but not extremly so, so not bad overall.

Also discovered that innocent-looking cheese slices pack a great deal of calories, making beer look like some kind of weight-reducing diet drink. More üç∫ then!
