Two almost unrelated channels I've been following for quite a long time: [My Self Reliance](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIMXKin1fXXCeq2UJePJEog) and [Pure Living For Life](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChhBsM9K_Bc9a_YTK7UUlnQ). Both channels are documenting building a house in the wilderness with top-notch filming and editing, but that's about where the simmilarities end.

The Canda / Ontario channel is situated in a real jaw-dropping frozen wilderness. It's some kind a weekend project of some very talented and insightful guy. Actually, it's one of the most serious weekend projects I've ever encountered in the YouTube space. Really worth a shot, I especially like the long silence that accompanies most of the videos - just depicting Shawn at work, usually with hand tools only. Inspiring aesthethic experience.

The "yound couples in Idaho" channel is simply one of the most detailed builds depicted everywhere, coupled by excellent editing skills. The couple sometimes ramble endlessly and I can assume that every possible (and costly) mistake has been done in this house build, but that is to be expected in any first-house build. I wouldn't dare do such a thing, let along documenting it for everyone to see. Their Instagram account is also a fine one.
