Just trying something - back to the 'ol calories count, but with a twist: Only 200 calories after 18:00. Arbitrary number and arbitrary time, but you have to try something, anything, to control those evening/night feeding frenzies.

I am also trying to frame the sleeping hours into some pattern, but nothing conclusive yet.

Muscles are still aching from the 8-minute exercise I did on day one (yes, 8 minutes only...). Nevertheless, I should be able to do another round today. I can no longer do a full-steam-ahead restart, and exercising a few minutes for each session is probably wiser - the last restart was actually successful.

I am really beginning to like this Jekyll stuff. For example, this is the link to the [First day stats]({% post_url 2018-07-02-restart-day-one %}). It just works.
