With all the moderation and restraints and balance I'm trying to acheive, I fell yet again into some consumerism trap due to an idea or thought that I simply could not get out of my head. Damn you, Christoper Nolan. Anyway, some kind of proper A/V setup is underway, which includes a receiver with a powered subwoofer channel (rare) and two surround speakers.

Speaking of speakers, that was an interesting search - there is a nice market of powered monitors which sounds great according to the reviews and boast a dirt-cheap price tag, like the JBL LSR305. Their price tag here is simply insane.

Anyway, this particular setup of powered monitors is not playing along well with standard receivers that don't have pre-outs. Big honking receivers are out of the question in my living room setup, there is no point of filling the whole cabinet with a single device. Oh well, how did I get here?... Ah, yes - I've done a search for available cheap passive speakers here, there are some nice options but not enough, and the second-hand market is... errrr... tragic as usual - people rip out plastic speakers from boom boxes and try to sell those at a higher price than the original boom box. Sheesh.

Anyway (2), after checking the options in ebay (as appaling as the local options), I got back to the old and faithful (or demonic?) Amazon, and re-discovered the Dayton Audio options. They have 4" and 6" speakers that are DIRT CHEAP, so no matter how bad they are, it won't hurt. The intended use is back/surround speakers anyway. Finding a matching pair to my Mission speakers, either bookshelves or floor-standing, is expensive, and I actually don't need more bass - the M71 have a nice mid-bass and my scrap-subwoofer (scrapwoofer?) fills the lower frequencies quite well when powered properly.

I hope that's the last major dent in the budget for 2018. Oh, wait. We are going to IKEA in a few hours. Uh-oh.
