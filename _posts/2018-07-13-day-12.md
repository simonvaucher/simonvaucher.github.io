Did a round of sowing & transplanting. Not as green as the photo above, but green nonetheless. Apparently, given the right conditions, rosemary is quick to send out great-looking roots from cuttings. I should be following this with pictures ðŸ˜£.

Sidenote: Just succumbed to a series of impulsive buys from the big A. I've managed to restrain myself quite well in 2018, up until now. Ouch. The excuse for that  move was probably my mind has telling me that I should compensate for the cancellation of NetFlix. Ha! that compensation already cost me several years of Netflix usage. Classic. ðŸ˜³
